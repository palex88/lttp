lttp is an app that helps you save interesting things from the internet.

Like bookmarks, but hopefully better someday.

It's written in Go, and the server architecture draws from the Go `net/http` [web app tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/), although most of that code has been removed at this point.

## Planned features:
* Custom Go web server and database connection
* HTML templating with CSS styling
* Mysql backend hosted on Amazon RDS
* Saving, reorganizing, and categorizing links
* Website thumbnails
* Categorization filters
